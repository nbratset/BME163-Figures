This repository hosts the final PNGs of all the assignments I completed in UCSC's course: BME163 - Applied Visualization and Analysis of Scientific Data.

All of these figures were generated using Python, MatPlotLib and NumPy. 

I will not be uploading the code that generated all of these images in case a future BME163 student stumbles across this repository.
